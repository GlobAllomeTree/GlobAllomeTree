             The Allometric equation's database center provides access to the tree allometric equations by ecological zones, countries or continents.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Allometric equations can be used to assess volume, biomass and carbon of trees in various types of forests (native, secondary, bamboo, mangroves, plantations etc.).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The data are collected from the scientific literature, reports from logging companies, conference proceedings, and national reports. The data are harmonized to facilitate their use (access to the methodology).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The harmonization procedure takes into account the tree components (stem, root, branch, leaf, etc..), geographical location (ecological zone, country, continent), the statistics information (correlation coefficient , sample size, confidence intervals etc.) and the reference.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The data are those originally reported by the authors. Errors can appear in certain equations. We try to detect errors and suggest corrections. The users can find a list of suggested equations in case errors are detected (access to modified database).            </p>
