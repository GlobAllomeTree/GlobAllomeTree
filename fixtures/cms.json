It consists of different modules that serve different purposes and are complementary.</p>\n<h4>1 Compare tree allometric equations</h4>\n<p>This module allows the comparison of existing tree allometric equations for a given geographical location (a site, an ecological zone, a country, a continent). The user can select the ecological classification from five different sources (FAO, Udvardy, WWF, Holdridge, and Bailey). The results obtained from the analysis can be downloaded by the users.</p>\n<h4>2 Assess volume, biomass and carbon stocks</h4>\n<p>This module allows the calculation of volume, biomass and carbon stocks, the calculation of descriptive statistics (error, confidence interval, median etc.) and comparison of data obtained according to the default values \u200b\u200bfrom the scientific literature. Moreover, it is a robust tool to assess the variable of interest and control teh results obtained.</p>\n<h4>3 Insert new equations</h4>\n<p>This module allows the entry of new tree allometric equations and enrich the database. New allometric equations will be inserted into the database of the user and can be submitted to GlobAllomeTree for insertion in the online database.</p>\n<p>The databases provided under this website can be imported in Fantallometrik Software as TXT files.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-block\">\n<button class=\"close\" type=\"button\">\u00d7</button>\n FANTALLOMETRIK\u00a0 Software (c) is a free software and works only under windows operating systems.

You can whether select your country on the map or select the name of your country using the filter \u201clocation\u201d. When no allometric equations are provided it means that no documents were collected.</li></ul></li>\n<li><strong>Can I use volume equations to assess tree biomass?</strong><ul><li>Biomass can be calculated using volume, wood density and biomass expansion factors. The use of biomass tree allometric equations is generally more accurate than using volume equations mainly because of the lack of adequate biomass expansion factors.</li></ul></li>\n<li><strong>What is the difference between individual tree and stand equations?</strong><ul><li>Allometric equations for volume and biomass can be provided for individual trees, sprout or stand. While individual tree equations provide volume or biomass for one tree, stand equations provide volume or biomass on a per hectare basis.</li></ul></li>\n<li><strong>How can I develop new equations?</strong><ul><li>The manual for building tree volume and biomass allometric equations provides advices and the necessary information on how to develop tree allometric equations.  This Manual is the first tool to provide all the necessary information from the field measurements to biomass estimation.</li></ul></li>\n<li><strong>Can I use equations from the website to assess the forest volume, biomass and my carbon stocks for a certain forest in my country?</strong><ul><li>The database is mainly developed to facilitate users to access tree allometric equations and improve volume, biomass or carbon stock assessment. At current status Globallometree does not provide recommendations on how to improve accuracy of forest biomass estimates. There is no clear agreement among scientists on the preference between volume or biomass equations, species \u2013specific or generic equations. It is furthermore recommended, when possible, to achieve the appropriate field measurements to identify the adequate method.</li></ul></li>\n<li><strong>Why Can\u2019t I download the software or the database?</strong><ul><li>If you are not a registered user, you cannot download the databases, documents and software. Users need to request the data access. Once approved by the administrator, users can access the documents.</li></ul></li>\n<li><strong>Are the data freely accessible?</strong><ul><li>All the data and products provided by Globallometree are freely accessible. In order to ensure the improvement of the platform and answer to user\u2019s questions, users cannot circulate or redistribute the downloaded products. Users are encouraged to read attentively the disclaimer and terms of use for the database and the software. The database and the software are protected by copyrights.</li></ul></li>\n<li><strong>How can I contribute to Globallometree?</strong><ul><li>Users are encouraged to provide comments at: Globallometree@fao.org. This will help the team to improve the webplatform and provided products. Users are encouraged to contribute to the enrichment of the allometric equation database by submitting their own database. Users can develop their own database using Fantallometrik software or the tutorial for database development. The file should be uploaded or sent as CSV file encoded as UTF-8.</li></ul></li>\n<li><strong>How can I output a UTF-8 CSV from Excel?</strong><ul><li>A simple workaround is to use Google Spreadsheet. Paste (values only if you have complex formulas) or import the sheet then download CSV.Another possibility is to use Notepad++ and encode the file in UTF-8 (menu \u201cEncoding\u201d, \u201d convert to UTF-8\u201d). http://notepad-plus-plus.org/</li></ul></li>\n<li><strong>Why do you provide the data using one database? Why some equations are found in more than one line?</strong><ul><li>All the necessary data are found in one table. The users are free to modify the structure of the database for their own use to avoid repetition of the data such as tree species or location. This is particularly the case when one equation is developed using the data from more than one location or from more than one tree species. In this case the equation will be repeated in the database as many times as the number of locations and species used to develop the equation.  The objective is to facilitate the insertion and use of the data from various types of users including beginners.</li></ul></li>\n<li><strong>How can I develop my own allometric equation database?</strong><ul><li>All the necessary information is provided by the tutorial for database development. The tutorial provides detailed information on the database structure and about the procedures and methodology for entering the data. Additional useful information is also provided such as how to search articles, reports and documents containing allometric equations; how to manage the references using RIS format reference management software; how to geo-reference and to spatialize the data using the most common GIS software.</li></ul></li>\n<li><strong>How can I control the quality and the reliability of the equations?</strong><ul><li>When available , statistical regression parameters of the equations are reported in the database, such as sample size, R2 and SEE. Furthermore, with Fantallometrik software you can check and compare the  equations and perform the quality control in order to eliminate the  equations  predicting wrong or unrealistic values.</li></ul></li>\n<li><strong>How can I find the original article where the equations was published?</strong><ul><li>For each equation in the database,  information about authors, year and reference of the original documents where the equation was found is reported. The platform also provides updated links to the most relevant scientific journals for tree allometry and biomass assessment.</li></ul></li>\n<li><strong>How can I apply the equations to my field data?</strong><ul><li>If you already have your field measurements  and you want to assess the biomass or volume using allometric equations, you can  freely download the software Fantallometrik from the website.  Fantallometrik is the first tool for assessing volume, biomass and carbon taking into account the existing tree allometric equations at continental and global level and can easily and rapidly apply the equations to your field data and perform the calculations.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>"
